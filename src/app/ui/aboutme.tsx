            <p>
                I&apos;m a tech lead, passionate about solving complex problems,
                with simple and elegant solutions I specialize in backend
                engineering, system design, and data-driven insights. I thrive
                in technical leadership roles, balancing hands-on development
                with mentoring and decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond software engineering, I have a strong interest in machine
                learning and analytics, often uncovering key insights that drive
                business decisions. My goal is to transition fully into data
                science, applying my problem-solving skills to data modeling,
                machine learning, and AI-driven solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I&apos;m currently looking for opportunities in data science,
                machine learning, and analytics, where I can leverage my
                software engineering background while deepening my expertise in
                data-driven decision-making.
